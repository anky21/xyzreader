This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

## Why this Project

This project gives me an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.
